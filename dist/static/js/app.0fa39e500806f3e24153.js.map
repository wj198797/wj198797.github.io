 <br>\n  <br>\n  <h4>Q2: 积分用来做什么？</h4>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  可以在积分商城兑换各种礼品。\n  <br>\n  <br>\n <h4> Q3: 礼品兑换很多天了还没有收到，该怎么办？</h4>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  礼品从兑换日起，3个工作日（周末不算）内处理发货，发货后，通常会在3个工作日左右送达。\n <h4> Q4: 礼品兑换中的手机充值卡兑换，怎么样进行充值，充值之前会和我电话确认嘛？</h4>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  不会，手机充值卡兑换，是直接充值到您填写的手机号上，充值之前不会和您电话确认，所以您在填写电话的时候，请确认电话是否正确。\n</section>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        name:
